    <!-- Application Description -->
    <h4>What is Squire?</h4>
    <p>
        Squire is the webapp developed by the UUPS-committee, which is the ICT committee of ESRG Knights of the Kitchen Table.
        Its goal is to provide members with more insight in the going-ons inside the association as well as aid the board
        in running the association. For instance members can adjust their personal data, view the committees, boardgames
        and roleplaying games. Over time we undboubtedly will add more functions.
    </p>

    <h4>Sign up for activities</h4>
    <p>
        Members can sign up for activities using this platform. This way, the board will know how many people will
        show up.
    </p>
    <p>

        Please send an email to <a href="mailto:bestuur@kotkt.nl">the board</a> to let them know!
